# messageform.at

This is the website and subsequent tool to help generate ICU Messageformat style messages.

These can be used with any ICU Messageformat implementations, but are tested specifically with [messageformat.js](https://github.com/slexaxton/messageformat.js).

## Goals

I'd like this to be a resource for people learning how to write well-formatted messages.

I'd also like this to be usable for translators who don't need to know the actual messageformat syntax. It's well thought out for programmers, but unfortunately leaves translators a bit in the dust.
